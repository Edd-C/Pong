# Pong

A simple pong game that is a work in progress. My intention was to write a minimally viable pure HTML5/Javascript game engine to learn about game programming concept and design patterns. It has been a good learning expereince so far and is still a work in progress. I would still like to implement:

* Stack-Based Finite State Machine
* Caching for the Render step.
* A class for user input. Mouse and keyboard.
* A base entity class.
* A base vector class.
* An audio class.
* Simple game menu capability.

I spent several days reading both of the following resources which were thoughtfully laid out and very well articulated. Hit tip to both of these gentlemen. I used some concepts I liked from each as well as other internet based resources.
